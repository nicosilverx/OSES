When configuring the sytstem, R\+T-\/\+Druid generates an O\+R\+TI file. The O\+R\+TI file is a text file containing information for debuggers related to the OS objects that are statically configured in the system.

The presence of an O\+R\+TI file simplifies kernel-\/aware debugging in advanced debugging systems such as Lauterbach T\+R\+A\+C\+E32 and i\+System Win\+Idea.

The generated O\+R\+TI follows the original O\+S\+E\+K/\+V\+DX O\+R\+TI specification for single core configurations, and follows the O\+R\+TI S\+MP extensions defined by Lauterbach and i\+System for multi core configurations.
