E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 is an open-\/source R\+T\+OS implementation of the O\+S\+E\+K/\+V\+DX A\+PI, available for various microcontrollers on the \href{http://www.erika-enterprise.com}{\texttt{ E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 web page}}.

E\+R\+K\+A3 offers the availability of a real-\/time scheduler and resource managers allowing the full exploitation of the power of new generation micro-\/controllers and multicore platforms while guaranteeing predictable real-\/time performance.

The advanced features provided by E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support for the O\+S\+E\+K/\+V\+DX and A\+U\+T\+O\+S\+AR conformance classes to match different application requirements;
\item Support for preemptive and non-\/preemptive multitasking;
\item Support for fixed priority scheduling;
\item Support for stack sharing techniques, and one-\/shot task model to reduce the overall stack usage;
\item Support for shared resources;
\item Support for periodic activations using Alarms and Schedule Tables;
\item Support for centralized Error Handling;
\item Support for hook functions;
\item Support for execution on automotive multicore platforms.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 kernel is a complete O\+S\+E\+K/\+V\+DX environment, with the additional extensions required by the A\+U\+T\+O\+S\+AR OS specifictaion, which can be used to implement multithreading applications on single and multicores.

E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 can be configured using the O\+IL language (through the R\+T-\/\+Druid3 plugins publicly available on the \href{http://www.erika-enterprise.com}{\texttt{ E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 website}}) or using A\+U\+T\+O\+S\+AR X\+ML (using the Evidence\textquotesingle{}s R\+TE generator).

The O\+IL language has been standardized by the O\+S\+E\+K/\+V\+DX Consortium as a standard configuration language used for the static definition of the R\+T\+OS objects which are instantiated and used by the application. E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 fully supports the O\+IL language for the configuration of real-\/time applications, adding specific extensions to support complete application building, and to support the A\+U\+T\+O\+S\+AR OS feature configuration.

The purpose of this document is to describe in detail the E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 A\+PI. Details about specific architecture can be found in dedicated \href{http://www.erika-enterprise.com/wiki/index.ph}{\texttt{ architecture wiki pages}}.
