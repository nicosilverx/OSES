The interface proposed is suited for small 8 to 32 bit architectures, and proposes an environment where tasks can execute concurrently exchanging data with a shared memory paradigm. Support for synchronization primitives is also provided.

Tasks in E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 are scheduled according to fixed priorities, and share resources using the Immediate Priority Ceiling protocol.

On top of task execution there are interrupts, that always preempt the running task to execute urgent operations required by peripherals, or, in case of a multicore system, by other C\+P\+Us.

The scheduling policy of E\+R\+I\+K\+A3 is a Fixed Priority Scheduling with Immediate Priority Ceiling. As a result, the following case of tasks may be implemented\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Full Preemptive Task}\+: A Full Preemptive task is a task that can be preempted in each instant by higher priority tasks.
\item {\itshape Non Preemptive Task}\+: A Non Preemptive task is like a Full Preemptive task that executes all the time locking a resource with its ceiling equal to the maximum priority in the system. As a result, a non preemptive task cannot be preempted by other tasks\+: only interrupts can preempt it.
\item {\itshape Mixed Preemptive Task}\+: A Mixed Preemptive task is like a task that executes all the time locking a pseudo-\/resource (also called {\itshape Internal Resource}. As a result, only tasks with higher priority than the ceiling of the Internal Resource, and interrupts, can preempt it.
